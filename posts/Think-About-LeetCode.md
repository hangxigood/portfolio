A year ago I tried asking Claude a LeetCode problem, it was a problem I had thought about for 2 hours, but the AI solved it in one second (I know it might have searched the internet haha), that made me really frustrated, then I lost my motivation to do LeetCode.

Recently, I started doing it again , because I noticed many companies still use LeetCode problems for interviews. 

I have been practicing consistently for almost a month now, I feel like my brain's "context" is getting larger, it's like a CPU - data needs to be stored first before it can be processed. 

For me, if there isn't enough stored data, my thoughts easily break apart, and lose the connection and imagination needed for problem-solving. Maybe using a pencil and paper is a good idea, but somehow I can't clearly draw out exactly what I am thinking.

Yeah I know there are problem-solving pattens, but our goal is not just to crack the problem - we want to learn something, right? I feel these problems might appear in the future(Whether in software development or real life) in different forms. I can still use those pattens and my brain's strengthened "problem-solving muscle" to tackle them.
