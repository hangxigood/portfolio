To be honest, I am a 31-year-old (almost 32) ,  a little bit fat, a male who always complains about neck pain or back pain (maybe 7 years office life have ruins my body?)

I never cared about my appearance before, not even before I got married ( Yeah my wife hopes she can feel abs on me but I have never make her dream come true). After I had a kid, the situation got worse, spending time with family, dealing with the trivial matters of life, and work  gradually became less exciting. I made myself into a stereotypical middle-aged man and didn't care about it. 

But I see someone here, older than me, who looked like he was 20. Crap, a guys I imagined my son might looked like in the future, is older than me. I was speechless, only my fat belly reminded me that I should make a change.

I am changing, and I feel my mind getting clearer, and those body pains are fading. 
I don't need to be handsome or charming, but I should always try my best to be a better version of myself.
